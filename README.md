# april-music-player
Music Player with lyrics syncing, note taking feature for lyrics memorization.


### Installation

- If youâ€™d like to use the project without setting it up, I have compiled versions for both Linux and Windows. You can download them from the [Releases](https://github.com/amm926616/april-music-player/releases) section. After downloading, unzip the file and run the main executable by double-clicking it.
- To run the project with Python, clone or download the repository:
    
    `git clone https://github.com/amm926616/april-music-player.git` or download the repo.

- Go inside the folder.
    
- (Optional) Create a virtual environment:

    `python -m venv .venv source .venv/bin/activate`
    
- Install the required modules:

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    
- Run the main script:
    
    `python main.py`
    

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Left Arrow, Right Arrow, Spacebar**: Seek backward, seek forward, and play/pause, respectively.
- **Ctrl + L**: Activate LRC display, or double-click the progress bar.
- **Ctrl + S**: Focus and place cursor on search bar.
